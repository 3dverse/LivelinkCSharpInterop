A naïve and minimal sample on how to call nodejs module from .NET runtime using the microsoft [node-api-dotnet](https://microsoft.github.io/node-api-dotnet/scenarios/dotnet-js.html).

Be patient on the livelink connect button click, the join session might take 3 seconds.

It would really be worth a try to test [edge-js](https://github.com/agracio/edge-js) which seems more advanced, nodejs 22 compatible, and likely more user friendly.
I'm really not happy with node-api-dotnet which lacks documentation, though there are 2 samples of interest:

Still edge-js might be a dead end...
